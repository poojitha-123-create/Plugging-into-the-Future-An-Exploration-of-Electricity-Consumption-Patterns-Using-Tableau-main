Plugging into the Future
Electricity Consumption Analytics using SQL, Tableau & Flask

📊 Plugging into the Future is a data-driven project analyzing electricity consumption patterns across Indian states for 2019–2020 using Tableau.

📁 The project processes structured time-series electricity data stored in MySQL for advanced analytical querying.

📈 It visualizes year-wise trends, monthly variations, and seasonal electricity demand fluctuations.

🌍 Interactive dashboards present region-wise distribution and state-level consumption insights.

🔎 Top and bottom consuming states are identified using SQL aggregation and ranking queries.

🦠 Lockdown impact analysis compares electricity usage before and after March 25, 2020.

📉 Growth rate calculations highlight demand shifts between 2019 and 2020.

🗺 Geographic map visualization shows state-wise electricity distribution across India.

⚙️ Optimized SQL queries (17 analytical queries) ensure efficient data aggregation and performance.

🎛 Dynamic filters allow users to explore data by Year, Region, State, and Lockdown Period.

📖 A Tableau Story presents structured insight narration across multiple analytical scenes.

🌐 The web interface is built using Flask and Bootstrap for embedding the Tableau Public dashboard.

🚀 The project demonstrates how data analytics supports energy planning, grid optimization, and policy decision-making.
